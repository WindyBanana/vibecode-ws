# Welcome! 👋

**Hello! This project will help you build something amazing.**

Whether you're a non-developer with an idea, an entrepreneur wanting to bring a vision to life, or anyone curious about building apps - you're in the right place.

**Happy coding!** (Well, happy *talking* - your AI does the coding!)

## Get Started in 3 Steps

### 1. Click "Use this template"

Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top of this page.

This creates your own copy with all the files you need.

### 2. Open in your AI editor

Open your new repository in any AI coding assistant:
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Claude Code
- OpenAI Codex (ChatGPT Plus/Pro)
- VS Code with Copilot
- Or any other AI assistant

### 3. Just talk to your AI

Say anything to get started:

```
"Make me a website"
"Create a landing page for my bakery"
"Build a portfolio site"
"What can I do with this?"
```

**That's it!** Your AI will:
- Ask a few quick questions (first time only)
- Build exactly what you asked for
- Guide you through everything

No coding knowledge needed. No terminal commands to run. Just talk naturally!

## Available Services

Your AI has been pre-configured with instructions to help you set up these services:

- **Authentication** (Clerk) - User login and accounts
- **Database** (Convex) - Save data permanently
- **Hosting** (Vercel) - Put your app online
- **Logging** (Axiom) - Track errors and activity
- **Feedback** (Linear) - Let users report bugs
- **Documentation** (Context7) - Keep AI up-to-date

**All of these are completely optional!** Your AI can also help you with other services not listed here - these are just the ones with pre-written setup guides. Ask for anything you need!

## 🔄 Auto-Discovery of New AI Editors

Your project includes a GitHub Action that checks daily for new AI coding assistants and automatically generates configuration files for them.

**What happens:** Every day, the action checks if new AI editors (like Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) have been released and creates the necessary config files so they work with your project right away.

**What this means for you:** If a brand new AI editor launches tomorrow, your project will support it automatically. You can switch between any AI editor anytime!

**Important:** When you clicked "Use this template", you got a snapshot of the scripts at that moment. The action runs with your copy of those scripts. Template improvements made after you created your project won't be included automatically.

The auto-discovery only adds new editor configs. It never touches your code, settings, or files.
