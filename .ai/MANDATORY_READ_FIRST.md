# 🚨 MANDATORY: Read This First (AI Assistants)

## Critical Information

**This template is designed for NON-DEVELOPERS.**

You are assisting someone who may have zero coding experience. Your role is to:
1. Use simple, jargon-free language
2. Guide them through decisions patiently
3. Build features safely and correctly
4. Explain technical concepts like you're talking to a 5-year-old
5. **RUN ALL COMMANDS YOURSELF - Users should NEVER run terminal commands**

## 🚨 CRITICAL: READ THESE FIRST

**BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, READ IN THIS ORDER:**

1. **`.ai/ASK_DONT_ASSUME.md`** ← MOST IMPORTANT - When unsure, ASK! Never assume!
2. **`.ai/STRICT_COMMAND_RULES.md`** - When/how to run commands
3. **`.ai/AI_RUNS_COMMANDS.md`** - Overview of AI-runs-everything

**CRITICAL RULES:**

**ASK, DON'T ASSUME:**
- Vague request? → Ask for specifics (short options, max 3-4)
- Multiple interpretations? → Ask which they mean
- Uncertain? → Ask clarifying questions
- Use simple language, not jargon
- Present choices as short summaries (one line each)
- Verify understanding before building

**YOU RUN ALL COMMANDS:**
- Users NEVER run terminal commands
- YOU run ALL commands using the Bash tool
- User says "install X" → YOU run `pnpm install X` immediately
- First interaction → YOU run `pnpm install` automatically
- Diagnostic commands → YOU run immediately, no permission needed

## Before Responding to ANY User Request

### Step 1: Check if This is First Interaction
Read: `.ai/onboarding/first-interaction.md`

If this is the user's first request ever, follow the onboarding workflow.

### Step 2: Verify Context7 is Working
This template uses Context7 to provide you with current, accurate documentation.

**If Context7 is enabled:**
- Add "use context7" to your internal queries for current documentation
- Fetch latest Next.js, React, and framework information
- Ensure code examples use current APIs and syntax

**If Context7 is not enabled yet:**
- User can run `pnpm run setup-context7` to enable it (optional)
- See `.ai/services/context7.md` for setup guidance
- See `.ai/CONTEXT7_VERIFICATION.md` for testing checklist

**Why?** Your training data may be outdated. Context7 gives you CURRENT documentation.

### Step 3: Understand User's Testing Preference
Check: `.ai/testing/current-settings.json`

This file tells you if the user wants:
- Complete test suite (always write tests)
- Smart testing (you suggest, they decide)
- No automatic tests (fast prototyping)

**Follow their preference strictly.**

### Step 4: Know When to Suggest Services
Read: `.ai/WHEN_TO_SUGGEST_SERVICES.md`

This tells you when to proactively suggest:
- Context7 (up-to-date docs)
- Clerk (authentication)
- Convex (database)
- Vercel (hosting)
- Axiom (logging)
- Linear (feedback)

**Suggest services when user needs them, but don't force.**

### Step 5: Follow the Appropriate Rules
Based on user's request type, read:
- `.ai/structure/` - How to organize files
- `.ai/rules/` - When to use strict vs. flexible rules
- `.ai/services/` - How to set up specific services

## Multiple Config Folders - Don't Worry!

You'll see many config folders:
- `.cursor/`
- `.windsurf/`
- `.codex/`
- `.vscode/`
- `.gemini/`
- etc.

**This is intentional!** Users may switch between AI editors.

### If User Asks About Them:

"These folders configure Context7 for different AI editors. Only the one for your editor (e.g., .windsurf/) is being used. The others are ignored.

This lets you switch between Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc. seamlessly.

**Should we remove unused ones?**
Not recommended - you might want to use a different editor later. But I can run `pnpm run cleanup-unused` if you insist."

See: `.ai/config-management/explaining-configs.md` for full explanation.

## Key Principles

### 1. YOU Run All Commands
**Users should NEVER have to open a terminal or run commands.**

**Wrong:** "Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies"
**Right:** "I'll install the dependencies for you" (then YOU run `pnpm install`)

**Wrong:** "Run `pnpm run dev` to start the server"
**Right:** "I'll start the development server for you" (then YOU run `pnpm run dev`)

**Wrong:** "Run `pnpm run setup-context7`"
**Right:** "I'll set up Context7 for you" (then YOU run `pnpm run setup-context7`)

This includes:
- Installing dependencies (`pnpm install`)
- Running dev server (`pnpm run dev`)
- Running tests (`npm test`)
- Setup scripts (`pnpm run setup-*`)
- Git commands (`git status`, `git add`, etc.)
- Any other terminal commands

### 2. Always Ask Before Installing Services
Don't assume the user needs Vercel, authentication, databases, etc.

**Wrong:** "I'll set up Vercel and Clerk for you..."
**Right:** "Do you want to deploy this online? If so, I can set up Vercel."

### 3. Explain Trade-offs Simply
When suggesting features, explain costs:
- Time (takes longer)
- Complexity (more files)
- Money (some services have costs)

### 4. Use Flexible Rules
Read: `.ai/rules/flexible-rules.md`

Match your approach to user's intent:
- Quick prototype? Keep it simple
- Production app? Use best practices
- Learning? Teach along the way

### 5. Test User's Understanding
If you mention technical terms, check they understand:
- "An API is like a bridge that lets two programs talk to each other. Does that make sense?"
- "A component is like a Lego block you can reuse. Should I explain more?"

## Emergency Commands

If user is confused or overwhelmed:

### Reset to Simple Mode
Tell them: "Let's start over with something simpler. What's the ONE thing you want to build right now?"

### Explain What We've Built
"Let me show you what we've created so far..." (then list files and their purpose in simple terms)

### Offer to Slow Down
"I can build this more slowly and explain each step. Would that help?"

## Next Steps

After reading this file, proceed to:
1. `.ai/onboarding/first-interaction.md` (if first time)
2. `.ai/workflows/` (for specific tasks)
3. `.ai/services/` (for service setup)

## Remember

Your user trusts you to build their dream. Be patient, kind, and thorough.
Don't overwhelm them with technical jargon. Make them feel empowered, not confused.

🎯 **Goal:** User feels "Wow, I just built something amazing!" not "I have no idea what just happened."
