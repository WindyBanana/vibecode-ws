# Common Questions

## Getting Started

### Do I need to know how to code?

**No!** That's the whole point.

Just describe what you want in plain English. Your AI builds it for you.

### What AI editors work with this?

All major AI coding assistants:
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Claude Code
- OpenAI Codex (included with ChatGPT Plus/Pro)
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot
- Any other AI assistant

The template includes configuration for all of them.

### Do I need to run terminal commands?

**No!** Your AI runs all commands for you.

You never need to touch the terminal. Just talk to your AI.

### How long does it take to build something?

Depends on complexity:
- Simple landing page: 30 minutes
- Blog: 1-2 hours
- App with user accounts: 2-3 hours

Your AI tells you the estimated time before starting.

## Working with Your AI

### What if I don't know what to ask for?

Just say what you're trying to do:

```
"I want to promote my business online"
"I need to collect emails before I launch"
"Help me build a portfolio"
```

Your AI will ask questions to figure out exactly what you need.

### My AI seems confused. What should I do?

Be more specific:

**Instead of:** "Make it better"
**Try:** "Make the buttons bigger and blue"

**Instead of:** "Add a form"
**Try:** "Add a contact form with name, email, and message"

Your AI will ask clarifying questions if needed.

### Can I change things after they're built?

Absolutely! Just tell your AI:

```
"Make the header sticky"
"Add a phone number field to the form"
"Change the color scheme to dark mode"
```

Nothing is permanent. Experiment freely!

### What if something breaks?

Tell your AI what happened:

```
"I clicked the button and got an error saying [error message]"
"The form isn't sending emails"
"The page won't load"
```

Your AI will fix it and explain what went wrong.

## Features & Services

### Can I build a real, production-ready app?

Yes! This template uses:
- Next.js 16 (industry-standard framework)
- TypeScript (catches errors)
- Best practices throughout

Apps built with this can handle real users and traffic.

### What if I need a feature not mentioned in the docs?

Just ask your AI!

```
"Can we add a payment system?"
"I need a calendar feature"
"Can users upload files?"
```

Your AI will tell you if it's possible and how to do it.

### Do I need to use all the services (Clerk, Convex, etc.)?

No! They're all optional.

Start with just the template. Add services when you need them:
- Need user accounts? → Add Clerk
- Need to save data? → Add Convex
- Ready to deploy? → Add Vercel

Your AI suggests services at the right time.

### Can I use different services?

Yes! Ask your AI:

```
"Can I use Firebase instead of Convex?"
"I want to use Auth0 instead of Clerk"
```

Your AI can integrate most popular services.

## Testing

### What are the testing modes?

1. **Complete Test Suite** - AI writes tests for everything (safest)
2. **Smart Testing** - AI suggests tests for important features (balanced)
3. **No Automatic Tests** - Build quickly without tests (fastest)

You choose on first interaction. You can change anytime.

### Which testing mode should I choose?

**Learning or prototyping?** → No Automatic Tests (fastest)

**Building a real app?** → Smart Testing (balanced)

**Need maximum reliability?** → Complete Test Suite (safest)

Not sure? Start with Smart Testing. Change later if needed.

### Can I change testing modes?

Yes! Just tell your AI:

```
"Change testing mode to complete"
"Switch to no testing"
```

A tool that catches errors before they happen. Makes your code more reliable.

Again, your AI handles this. You just describe what you want.

Yes! All code is in your repository.

Want to understand how something works? Ask your AI:

```
"Can you explain how the contact form works?"

### Do I need Context7?

No, but it's recommended.

Helps ensure your AI uses current, accurate code.

### Is Context7 free?

Yes, for public projects.

### I want to start over

No problem! You can:

**Start fresh:**
```
"Let's start a new project"
```

**Undo recent changes:**
```
"Can we undo the last thing we did?"
```

**Try a different approach:**
```
"Let's try building this differently"
```

### Where can I get help?

1. **Ask your AI first** - It knows this template inside-out
2. **Check the docs** - [How It Works](HOW_IT_WORKS.md), [Services](SERVICES.md)
3. **GitHub Issues** - Report template bugs
