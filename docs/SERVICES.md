Recommended stack:
1. Start with the template
2. Add **Clerk** (authentication)
3. Add **Convex** (database)
4. Add **Vercel** (hosting)
5. Add **Axiom** (logging) after deployment

### Not Sure?
Ask your AI! For example:
```
"I want to build a task management app. What services do I need?"
```

Your AI will recommend exactly what you need.

## All Services Are Optional

You don't need any of these to get started!

The template works perfectly fine without them. Add services when you need them, not before.

Your AI will suggest services at the right time:
- Need to save data? → Suggests Convex
- Want user accounts? → Suggests Clerk
- Ready to deploy? → Suggests Vercel

**Questions about a service?** Just ask your AI:
```
"What's the difference between Clerk and Auth0?"
"How much does Vercel cost?"
"Can I use a different database?"
```
