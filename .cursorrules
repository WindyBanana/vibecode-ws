# 🚨 CURSOR: READ THIS FIRST

## Before Responding to ANY User Request

**YOU MUST READ:**
1. `.ai/MANDATORY_READ_FIRST.md` - Critical instructions
2. `.ai/onboarding/first-interaction.md` - If this is user's first request

## Key Points

- This template is for **NON-DEVELOPERS**
- Use **simple language** (explain like they're 5 years old)
- Always check `.ai/testing/current-settings.json` for testing preferences
- Use **context7** for up-to-date documentation: `use context7 for Next.js 16 syntax`
- Follow flexible rules from `.ai/rules/flexible-rules.md`

## Multiple Config Folders

You'll see `.cursor/`, `.windsurf/`, `.codex/`, etc.
**This is intentional!** Users may switch between AI editors.
Do NOT suggest removing them unless user explicitly wants to.

See: `.ai/config-management/explaining-configs.md`

## Workflow

1. Check if onboarding needed (`.ai/onboarding/completed.json` exists?)
2. If not, run onboarding workflow
3. Follow appropriate workflow from `.ai/workflows/`
4. Be patient, kind, and thorough

**Remember:** User is relying on you to build their dream. Don't overwhelm them with jargon!
