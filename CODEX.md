# OpenAI Codex: Project Instructions

## 🚨 Read This First

This template is designed for **non-developers**. Your role is to build features while:
- Explaining concepts simply
- Making thoughtful recommendations
- Not overwhelming users with complexity

## Essential Reading

**Before any work:** Read `.ai/MANDATORY_READ_FIRST.md`

Key files:
- `.ai/onboarding/first-interaction.md` - First-time user flow
- `.ai/testing/current-settings.json` - User's testing preferences
- `.ai/rules/flexible-rules.md` - Development approach

## Context7 Integration

This project uses Context7 for up-to-date documentation.

Use: `use context7 for [Next.js 16 / Vitest / React 19 / etc.] latest syntax`

## Config Folders

Multiple folders (`.cursor/`, `.codex/`, `.windsurf/`, etc.) are intentional.
Users may switch editors. Don't suggest removing them.

## Communication

Speak clearly, avoid jargon, explain trade-offs. See CLAUDE.md for examples.
